## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the governance process for Starknet, including non-voting governance, current scope of token-based governance, the current proposal process, and other information.

## Governance Phases

Starknet's governance is currently in Phase 1. This phase is characterized by off-chain token-based governance approving Starknet mainnet upgrades.

During this phase, StarkWare will upgrade the network according the the results of the vote.

Phase 2 will transition governance onchain to Starknet mainnet.

This phase will explore a technical roadmap for handing over L1 contract control to governance for further security and decentralization.

## Token-based Governance

The STRK token represents voting power in Starknet's governance process. The total voting power is distributed among different stakeholders, as follows:

- 1.7 billion tokens: Investors
- 1.7 billion tokens: Core-contributors (excluding StarkWare)
- 1.7 billion tokens: Foundation
- - 500M to delegates
- - 1.2b to builders council

### Delegation

Becoming a delegate is a permissionless process. Please post your profile on the community forum thread (link) as well as on the starknet delegate discovery page (link).

Starknet Governance Committee is tasked with creating a healthy delegate ecosystem. The goal can be viewed in the delegate onboarding announcement(link)

Token-holders are welcome to delegate to any address.

The Foundation has delegated 500 million tokens to over 80 delegates selected from the delegate pool. These delegates participate in the decision-making process by voting on proposals and representing the interests of the community.


### Builder's Council

The Foundation has also delegated 1.2 billion tokens to the Builder's Council. This council consists of key contributors and builders within the Starknet ecosystem. They play a crucial role in assessing proposals, ensuring that they align with the network's long-term vision and development. Read the Builders council mandate (link)

## Proposal Process

Before a network upgrade proposal is put to a vote, it is first deployed on the Goerli testnet for 1 day. This allows the community to test and evaluate the upgrade before voting. 
After this period, if the deployment is deemed viable, a 5-day voting window commences. If a majority votes are in favor of the proposal, Starknet's mainnet will be upgraded accordingly.

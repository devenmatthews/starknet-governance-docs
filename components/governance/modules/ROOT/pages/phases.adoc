= Governance Phases

Starknet's governance is currently in Phase 1. This phase is characterized by off-chain token-based governance approving Starknet mainnet upgrades.

During this phase, StarkWare will upgrade the network according the the results of the vote.

Phase 2 will transition governance onchain to Starknet mainnet.

This phase will explore a technical roadmap for handing over L1 contract control to governance for further security and decentralization.
